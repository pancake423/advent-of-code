## Advent of Code
My personal solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) written in Python.
Also includes a template and an init script that generates ready-to-use folders for each puzzle.

run `python init.py` to initialize a year's worth of puzzles. The command will prompt you to enter the year.

If you're using my solutions, init.py will also create empty text files where you can enter your puzzle input. They aren't tracked on git because
the creators [have asked us not to](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).
Feel free to repurpose template.py and init.py for your own use- any modifications to the template will be reflected when init is run.
